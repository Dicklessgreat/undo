//! **An undo-redo library.**
//!
//! It is an implementation of the [command pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_pattern),
//! where all modifications are done by creating objects that applies the modifications.
//! All objects knows how to undo the changes it applies, and by using the provided data
//! structures it is easy to undo and redo edits made to a target.
//!
//! # Features
//!
//! * [`Edit`] provides the base functionality for all edit commands. Multiple [`Edit`]s can be merged into a single edit
//!   by implementing the [`Edit::merge`] method on the edit. This allows smaller edits to be used to build
//!   more complex operations, or smaller incremental changes to be merged into larger changes that can be undone and
//!   redone in a single step.
//! * [`Record`] provides basic stack based undo-redo functionality.
//! * [`History`] provides full tree based undo-redo functionality.
//! * Queue and checkpoint functionality is supported for both [`Record`] and [`History`].
//! * The target can be marked as saved to disk and the user will be notified when it changes.
//! * The amount of changes being tracked can be configured by the user so only the `N` most recent changes are stored.
//! * Configurable display formatting using the display structures.
